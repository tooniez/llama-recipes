    "This notebook will walk you through [distilling](https://www.llama.com/docs/how-to-guides/distillation/) model knowledge from [Llama 4](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama4) into a smaller [Llama 3.2](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_2/) model using synthetic training data from [Synthetic Data Kit](https://github.com/meta-llama/synthetic-data-kit). \n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to distill knowledge from a more powerful model (Llama 4 Scout) into a smaller, less powerful model (Llama 3.2 3B).\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller models have several advantages when compared with larger models: they're faster to generate text, have lower time to first token, and cost less to host since they need less hardware. However, larger models tend to be generalists – that is, they have the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks well. On specific or specialized tasks, smaller models can be just as good as the generalist, larger models. Distillation allows you to take knowledge present in a larger model and transfer it to a smaller model with a minimal drop in quality for narrow tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data\n",
    "This notebook uses air traffic control data to demonstrate tuning a model towards a specialized field. During distillation, we will fully generate pairs from scratch, because our generalist teacher model has a strong understanding of ATC phraseology. During evaluation, we will evaluate both synthetic pairs as well as actual ATC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [ATCO2 corpus](https://github.com/idiap/atco2-corpus/tree/main) of air traffic data, an MIT-licensed dataset that contains audio, transcriptions, and additional contextual and metadata for each interaction. For this exercise we will only use the text transcripts, and will use the small (1h) sample dataset to demonstrate how only a small amount of data is actually necessary for fine-tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "To evaluate our model, we will use standard language evaluation metrics such as [perplexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity) and accuracy. We will also use [BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) (bilingual evaluation understudy) to measure similarity without requiring that the model matches exactly every word. While originally designed for machine translation, BLEU compares n-gram similarity, meaning that minor word order differences are not penalized."

We'll look at the metrics for both, as well as a \"vibe check\" where we manually inspect a few outputs to confirm the model is working how we expect. During evaluation, both metrics as well as manual spot checking are important -- metrics capture broad patterns and spot checking makes up for deficiencies in metrics."
